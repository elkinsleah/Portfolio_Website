## About

> One thing to know about me is that I always strive to add value to people's lives, whether through my career or personal life.

I am currently working in the dental field as a registered dental hygienist. As you may have guessed, I enjoy helping people. 
I love having my dental hygiene license because I can always use it to volunteer at free and charitable clinics. With all that 
being said, I am more than ready to transition to a full-time career in tech.

A career in technology will allow me to grow and maintain my creativity and problem-solving skills. I know that my experience
working in the diverse field of dentistry and my personal skills will carry over to my new career. I want something that will 
provide me with endless learning and progression. This will be another avenue where I can create something that will add value to other people's lives.

Thank you so much for viewing my portfolio!
